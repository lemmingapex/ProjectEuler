Compile It
----------
ant


Run It
------
./target/coinsums.jar 200

Thoughts
--------
The first approach uses a subset-sum method, which way overkill for this problem; gets the right answer in time regardless (as well as every answer less than 200)...

Second approach is much faster and uses recursion.

Run-time
--------
Unknown
