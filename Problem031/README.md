Compile It
----------
ant


Run It
------
./target/coinsums.jar 200

Thoughts
--------
Used a subset-sum approach, which way overkill for this problem; gets the right answer in time regardless (as well as every answer less than 200).  Should have uses a simple recursive program instead.

Run-time
--------
Unknown
