## Compile It
ant


## Run It
java -jar ./target/almostequilateraltriangle.jar N

N is 1000000000 in this case.

## Thoughts
This problem was pretty tough.  Got help from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heronian_triangle and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_triangle#Heronian_triangles.

## Run-time
Unknown.
