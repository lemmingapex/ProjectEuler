# [Cube digit pairs](http://projecteuler.net/problem=90)

## Compile It
ant


## Run It
java -jar ./target/cubedigitpairs.jar

## Thoughts
This problem was pretty terrible, not at all fun.  Took me a while to write the code to generate all the combinations of 10 choose 6.  Then just some gross code to loop over all the combinations and digits to check if combinations are valid.

## Run-time
Unknown.
